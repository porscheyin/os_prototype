OS prototype
============

This is a multi-task operating system prototype. Key components of this operating system include a process scheduler and a virtual memory manager. These modules are developed on the top of the simulated hardware in C on Linux.

The code in src/base is the existing codebase provided by the course. The rest code in src is written by me.
